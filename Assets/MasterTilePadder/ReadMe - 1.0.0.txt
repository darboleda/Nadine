Thank you for buying Master Tile Padder!



How to Use

After installing, from the Window menu, select MasterTilePadder. From the Window that appears, select the texture of the tiled sprites, enter the dimensions, enter the number of pixels you want to pad, and press "Generate Padded Texture".
If you have NGUI installed, you can go into the code "MasterTilePadder.cs" and uncomment the first line, which is "//#define HAS_NGUI". This will create a "NGUI Atlas" checkbox in the window. If you select this, and then press "Generate Padded Texture", the code will generate both the padded texture along with the NGUI sprite atlas.
